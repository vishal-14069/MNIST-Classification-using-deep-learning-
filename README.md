# MNIST-Classification-using-deep-learning-
Deep Learning is used for classifying the MNIST dataset, and determining the hand written letters present in the dataset.

The dataset is called MNIST and refers to handwritten digit recognition. 

The dataset provides 70,000 images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits (1 digit per image). 

The goal is to write an algorithm that detects which digit is written. Since there are only 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), this is a classification problem with 10 classes. 

The goal is to build a neural network with 2 hidden layers.

Feel free play around with the parameteres of the model such as number of epochs, number of hidden layers, activation functions, optimizer, hidden layer size and the loss.

The hyper-paramters used in the model are:

Number of hidden layers: 2
Activation functions used : Relu and Softmax
Number of Epochs used: 10
Hidden Layer Size: 100

Training Accuracy: 99.62%
Testing Acccuracy: 97.88%

Better testing accuracy can be achieved by tweaking the hyper-parameters

Packages Used:

Tensorflow 2.9.2
